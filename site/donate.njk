            Human Utility Water
          </a>
          is a human right. But, the United States has a water affordability
          problem. In places like Detroit, Baltimore, and other cities, families
          unable to afford their water bills have their water shut off. When
          this happens, kids can't bathe, people can't wash dishes, and
          grandparents can't flush their toilets. The Human Utility is
          non-profit organization providing help to families and makes sure they
          always have running water at home.
